  <p><strong>Instructions: Click the link below to review the Website. Find the cheapest ounce of weed and enter the price. Follow these rules for knowing which price to use:</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>Do not change the location from the link provided. If the link is to a marketplace, do not select a different vendor. If a specific city is selected, don't change cities.</li>
    <li>Only consider "flower". Do not consider edibles, concentrates, hash, or any form of weed other than the bud.</li>
    <li>An ounce is 28g. Always use the prices for product closest in weight to an ounce without going over. If ounce prices are available, use those.</li>
    <li>If there are no prices for exactly an ounce, use multiples of the largest quantity available, without going over. For example, if 1/2 oz. (14g) is selling for $100 cheapest, then the cheapest price for an ounce is $200.</li>
    <li>Do not use prices if they are for more than an ounce. If 2 oz. (56g) are available, do not use their prices. Use the closest quantity for sale less than or equal to an ounce.</li>
    <li>Only consider products that contain some THC. CBD or other types of flower are not to be counted.</li>
    <li>Sativa vs indica is not relevant. Neither are growing conditions, THC concentration, or other attributes. As long as the price is for THC containing flower, it can be included.</li>
  </ul>

<h6>WARNING: A typical ounce of weed is $100 - $400. Sometimes the price is more expensive than $400, but it is almost never less than $100. If you are entering prices less than that, you are probably doing something wrong.</h6>
<p>If the website is not loading, then put $0. If you are SURE that there is no inventory at the vendor, put $0.<p>
